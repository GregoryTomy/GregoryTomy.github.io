### Check out my latest [LLM + RAG project](https://github.com/GregoryTomy/wine-llmops)!

Developed a sommelier chatbot that helps you find the wine for your taste using Microsoft Azure, LangChain, and Retrieval-Agumented Generation (RAG). The app is powered by FastAPI and Streamlit. CI/CD with GitHub Actions. Special thanks to Ivan Portilla for providing me access to Azure OpenAI and his excellent Applied Deep Learning course at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
You can demo the ChatBot Here: [Barney](https://barneyllm.azurewebsites.net/)
