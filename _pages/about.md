I am a Master's student at the University of Colorado Boulder, specializing in Applied Mathematics with a focus on Statistics and Machine Learning, set to graduate in May 2024. 

I bring over [three years of professional work experience]() in financial data analysis and have completed multiple data science and machine learning internships at notable organizations, including technology manufacturing at [GlobalFoundries](https://gf.com), research at [Sandia National Laboratories](https://www.sandia.gov/), and healthcare analytics at [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/).

Currently, I am engaged in an independent study focused on Causal Inference and its applications in data science. As my graduation approaches, I am actively seeking full-time opportunities in `Data Science and Machine Learning Engineering`, with a particular interest in MLOps.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
